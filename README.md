# What I learned during the Simon-html assignment

The Simon-html assignment was the most tricky and diffciult assignment that I completed in this class so far. I had issues with cloning a repository into another repository. For some reason, they didn't sinc up, so whatever changes I made in my decelopment environment, I couldn't push to GitHub. Eventually with the help of some TAs I was able to figure out the issue. DO NOT clone a repository into another one. Just download the zip and paste the files into one repository. This solves all the issues and everything syncs perfectly. 

Something else I learned was that web development is very tedious. For some reason, I expected that if I make a change in one of the html files, it would show up on the other pages too, as long as what I changed is a shared attribute across all pages. This was not at all the case. You need to go into every file and change everything one by one.

# What I learned during the Simon-CSS assignment

The Simon-CSS assignment was quite tricky and it took me longer than expdcted to complete. Web Programming it not easy, and one small mistake can break the whole website. I also had issues with committing and pushing the changes to my git repository, even though I thought I figured out these issues last time. Eventually, I was able to just create my own files and copy and paste any code into them wirhout cloning the repository from the CS 260 repository.

Bootstrap is very useful, but I am learning that it does have its limitations. Even though I worked many hours on my Simon CSS, I do feel like it doesn't look much different from the original example. This makes it a little boring and not so fun. 

Notes:
- Use "justify-content" to fix dynamic issues: like when the page looks funny in a smaller window
- Don't forget that if you change something on one of the pages, it doesn't change in the other pages

# Reflecting on Startup HTML and CSS

The Startup HTML and CSS assignment was a big milestone and a great learning experience. My main goal was to have fun and push myself to do the best I can and deliver the best possible looking website. Something I have realized during the development process is that at times it is difficult to imagine what the end result will look like. 

Notes:
- Always take it one task at the time
- Remember that your files aren't automatically linked
- When you create deployFiles.sh, you need to modify accessibility in the terminal (Otherwise you can't deploy to your server)
- Git push often! It is a way to double save your work
- If you have difficulties with your development environment, copy everything to CodePen and keep working until help arrives
- Don't worry too much about what isn't required now. JavaScript will make everything better.

# Simon JavaScript

This assignment was much harder than I expected. Initially, I attempted to write JavaScript from scratch, but nothing worked for hours. I didn't realize that it wasn't enough to just make new functions in JavaScript. Everything needs to be referenced in the HTML files as well. This made the assignment from scratch extremely difficult. I ended up cloning the example repo and worked on understanding the code rather than creating everything from scratch. It was overall a great learning experience, but this assignment definitely made me nervous about my startup JavaScript.
