# startupChange from my development environment
# learning GitHub
# I learned that using VS Code with GitHub is the best option for this class and the assignments. 
# Other IDEs, like CLion don't work as well, and make it a lot more difficult to navigate.
# I also learned that GitHub is a very powerful tool and it will be useful in my studies, as well as my professional projects.
