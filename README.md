# What I learned during the Simon-html assignment

The Simon-html assignment was the most tricky and diffciult assignment that I completed in this class so far. I had issues with cloning a repository into another repository. For some reason, they didn't sinc up, so whatever changes I made in my decelopment environment, I couldn't push to GitHub. Eventually with the help of some TAs I was able to figure out the issue. DO NOT clone a repository into another one. Just download the zip and paste the files into one repository. This solves all the issues and everything syncs perfectly. 

Something else I learned was that web development is very tedious. For some reason, I expected that if I make a change in one of the html files, it would show up on the other pages too, as long as what I changed is a shared attribute across all pages. This was not at all the case. You need to go into every file and change everything one by one.
